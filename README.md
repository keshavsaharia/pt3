# Probabilistic Tic Tac Toe

This is a rough proof of concept inspired by [Cameron Sun's](https://www.csun.io/2024/06/08/probabilistic-tic-tac-toe.html) original concept of probabilistic tic-tac-toe, with a major improvement to the "AI player" (i.e. expectiminimax). With optimal play, a computer player should outperform a human player over time.
